# A Modular Synth Techno Rack based on DIY Kits

**Clearly techno!** That's how I got into the world of modular synthesizers. With my DIY drum machine I have laid the foundations. Now I want to make music!

I'm creating **a mobile rack to play live**. And because I can (and it's fun), I'm going to build it **based on DIY kits**.
