# One Module Per Month

Over a period of six months I will release one module per month as a buyable DIY kit.

## The Story Behind

When I started DIY synth stuff about two years ago, I looked in deep admiration at the makers of modules and DIY kits ðŸ¤© Nothing has been lost in the fascination. With the circuits and modules I built myself over time, I took bigger and bigger steps and was always grateful for the positive feedback! At the end of this year (2021), the opportunity has arisen to distribute my modules as DIY kits. And with this a little dream comes true for me ðŸ¦„

**Over a period of six months I will release one module per month as a buyable DIY kit.** I haven't done anything like that yet. That's why I'm looking forward to the ideas, through the wins and fails that arise along the way ðŸ’ª

From a big picture view I'm still iterating on my mobile Techno rack. This is where the specific ideas for my own modules come from, especially when these requirements are not yet served on the DIY kit market.

## Design Goals

When designing modules, I consider the experience of my DIY journey over the last 1.5 years. Having seen highest highs of euphoria and deepest valleys of demotivation, I know some pitfalls and try to keep my designs **as frustration-free as possible**.

I work with certain principles and constraints:

1. **Few different components** â€“ I try to limit the values and types to few and simple. For example, I am very happy if the values of the resistors in a kit are limited to 1K, 10K, and 100K.
2. **Components that are always available** â€“ I like to have all the components for a new kit already in my modest box. For example, that's why I like to use widely available op amps, like uA741 and TL072.
3. **Compact module design** â€“ I don't want to break or change my case. I need modules with as much functionality as possible in a limited space.
