title: DIY Drum Synthesizer
---

Sometime in May 2020 I woke up and knew I had to build my own **drum machine** from scratch. **Bass, snare and hi-hat** synthesized through current manipulation.

As a **synth and electronics newbie**, I first created a [software prototype based on VCV Rack](/projects/diy-drum-synthesizer/goal/Bumm Bumm Garage DIY Drum Synthesizer Prototype.mp4). Then over time, I worked out the necessary parts to complete my **modular drum synthesizer**.

See the resulting modules below and check their **video demos**, **schematics**, **stripboard/PCB layouts** and **references** to other fellows' designs ❤️️
