# A Modular Synth Techno Rack based on DIY Kits

**Clearly making techno!** That's how I got into the world of modular synthesizers. With [my DIY drum machine](/projects/diy-modular-synthesizer-drum-machine/) I have laid the foundations. Now I want to make music!

## Sound

This is the kind of music that I am envisioning:

* Lady Starlight, Karenn, Blawan, Hiroko Yamamura. 
* [German Underground Techno, Dark & Hard, Fear N Loathing in Berlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjF-9In3hqU&t=25s)
* [Charlotte de Witte - Form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvAJbFNuyCA)
* [Leipzig I (recorded with the Kaossilator App on my iPhone)](https://soundcloud.com/steffenlohaus/leipzig-i)
* [Style Guide: Techno (Sample project by James Wiltshire)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q6yR4s4syA&t=990s)

## Setup

I'm creating **a mobile rack to play live**. And because I can (and because it's fun), I'm building it **based on DIY kits**.

According to the video "[How to make a TINY live techno modular synth in only 62HP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jCCzpWBsFs)" by Mylar Melodies, you need: **drums, bass, lead (e.g. chords) and freaky noises**.

Following that approach, I'm adding what is missing and replacing what needs to be improved. **Step by step**.
