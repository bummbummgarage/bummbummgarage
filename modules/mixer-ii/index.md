# Mixer II

Ultra simple two-channel mixer in 2hp. You can mix audio signals, such as control voltage. There are attenuators and mute switches per channel.

I built the first iteration of this module for my techno rack. I needed a slim mixer to sum the two channels of my hihats module because I didn't have more channels left on my main mixer ðŸ’¡

In the run, I then served the requirement to be able to sum control voltage as well. I needed a way to mix envelopes for side chaining and have them non-inverted.

## Features

* âœ… 2 channels
* âœ… Attenuation and mute per channel
* âœ… Mixes audio signals and control voltage
* âœ… Buffered inputs

Rev2 Improvment Potential:

* Remark: DC offset will not be removed. Audio can be strange if it has DC offset.
* Clicking when muting.
