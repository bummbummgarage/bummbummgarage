# Mixer II

Ultra simple two-channel mixer in 2hp. You can mix audio signals, such as control voltage. There are attenuators and mute switches per channel. When not connected, the channels provide up to +6V and -6V, depending on the particular attenuation (inspired by the [intellijel Triplatt](https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/triplatt/)).

I built the first iteration of this module for my techno rack. I needed a slim mixer to sum the two channels of my hihats module because I didn't have more channels left on my main mixer ðŸ’¡

In the run, I then served the requirement to be able to sum control voltage as well. I needed a way to mix envelopes for side chaining and have them non-inverted.

## Features

* âœ… 2 channels
* âœ… Attenuation and mute per channel
* âœ… Mixes audio signals and control voltage
* âœ… Inputs are normalled to +6V and -6V
* âœ… Buffered inputs
* âœ… Non-inverted output
