# Case II

*Version 0.1 from December 2020*

![](Bumm-Bumm-Garage-Case-II-0.1-01.jpg)

Eurorack case that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. It's built around two pairs of rails with a length of 17.05 inch (43.3 cm).

## Details

I first designed the case in a free CAD software called [SketchUp for Web](https://www.sketchup.com//products/sketchup-for-web).

The outer dimensions are (W x H x D): 457 x 290 x 162 mm.

Then I went for it in the workshop ü™ö

I built the case around the rails with some blank panels to get the spacings 100%ly right.

Some fine hours later it was finished.

The rails are from [Schneidersladen in Berlin](https://schneidersladen.de/). I sawed the profile at the top of all four. This way I can easily get the square nuts in.

## Improvement Potential

I would have had more space (and less fiddling) between the screws for the rails if I had installed the profiles the other way around. Next time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
