Thesen / AnsÃ¤tze:
- "Card in or out doesn't make any difference"
- Die Power Filtering Caps von allen Modulen saugen so stark. --> "Emptying the case" --> "problem is still there"
- "I think there was also a software solution." (Radio Music) --> wo ist das?
- Mal ohne SD Card starten
- Mal alle raus und gucken, wo es Probleme gibt
- SD card holder braucht extra cap

- "I have fixed this issue on my board by re-flowing the solder on one of the electrolytic capacitors on the power input"

- "the WMD Soft Start made no difference"

- Soft Start Module: https://wmdevices.com/products/soft-start-module

- "the problem moved over with the card"

Hi guys, thnx for the contribution so far! I am experiencing the same problem, but am acutally happy having found this thread ðŸ˜…

My setup:
- Chord Organ DIY Kit Rev2 (the red one)
- SD card: SanDisk Ultra 32 GB
- PSU: Doepfer PSU3
- Digital module neighbourhood: Bastl Popcorn (Sequencer)

I tested the workaround of pulling the SD card out when starting up. After ~5 attempts with a (hopefully completely decharged system) it seem to fix the bug.

I would love to prevent or automate the workaround in the future.

That's why:
