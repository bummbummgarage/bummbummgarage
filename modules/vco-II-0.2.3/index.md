# VCO II

*Version 0.2.3 from March 2021*

![](160017333_213328790578242_8465238797184565485_n.jpg)

VCO that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. It's based on two LM358 and one TL072, deadly simple.

## Features

* âœ… Square and triangle wave
* âœ… Frequency range from 0 Hz to 3.5 kHz
* âœ… FM input with variable attenuation
* âœ… Current: +17mA (+12V), -7 mA (-12V)

## Details

This is the third PCB that I etched in lifetime. First one went into trash, second one works but soldering was a battlefield and this one is sufficiently fine ðŸ’¡
