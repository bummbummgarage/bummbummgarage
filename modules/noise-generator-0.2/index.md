## Noise Generator

*Version 0.2 from November 2020*

Noise generator that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. It includes white and pink noise for the basis of hi-hats and a snare drum. The circuit needs at least +/-12V to run.

The design is based on ["2tran_wn.gif" by richardc64 via electro-music.com](https://electro-music.com/forum/post-377739.html#377739) (white noise) and ["Noise source with passive filter" by SyntherJack](https://syntherjack.net/make-some-pink-noise-generator/) (pink noise filter).

### Improvement Potential

While plugging in the oscilloscope for the first time, I just realized the DC bias in the white noise â€“ to be removed in future development.
