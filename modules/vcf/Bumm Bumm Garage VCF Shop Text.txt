The Bumm Bumm Garage VCF is a voltage controlled low and high pass filter. It features everything that you need for creating special timbres in your voices or giving them a designated place in the mix.





It is based on the "late Korg MS20 filter" by Ren√© Schmitz 

‚Ä¶ with some chaotic ‚Ä¶ non-linear ‚Ä¶

Voltage controlled filter that I built for my techno rack. It‚Äôs based on ‚ÄúKorg late MS20 filter‚Äù by Ren√© Schmitz.

Ren√© explains in the description how to add the high pass input. I didn‚Äôt manage to make it a switch, so there are two separate inputs for high pass and low pass ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Then I accidentally found out that if I remove one of the diodes in the original design, the resonance gets a crunchy color (which I find particularly nice for bass voices). So I implemented this function with a switch: Soft and hard resonance.


Feedback:

BUILD:
- Few different components ‚Äì I try to limit the values and types to few and simple. For example, I am very happy if the values of the resistors in a kit are limited to 1K, 10K, and 100K.
- The usage is smooth, the build was easy
- Hi :) finished the filter, worked on first plug :) well done, it was fun to solder it and it was well designed. 


SOUND:
- hard resonance klingt richtig nice. Ich mag das nicht-lineare.
- Oh it works great, I love the sound
- I like that it‚Äôs not perfect and has some character, and adding the resonance switch was a good idea
- Actually it sounds amazing and the switch to hard/soft results in some great grit. All in all great filter, I‚Äôll not be letting it go anytime soon.
- Sounds cool, only tested it for a small session, the resonance is really nice.
