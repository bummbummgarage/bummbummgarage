## Envelope Generator II

*Version 0.1 from ‚Ä¶*

![](150886302_121161163246069_6775219902744277767_n.jpg)

Envelope Generator that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. It's based on the ["Simple DIY Envelope Generator" by Look Mum No Computer](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/simple-envelope-generator) ü•≥

### Features

‚úÖ Attack and release

‚úÖ 2 outputs (for e.g. VCO pitch and VCA)

‚úÖ Visual indication a.k.a. LED

### Improvement potential

Unfortunately the output voltage equals the input voltage in this implementation. That means only +5V coming from my sequencer. That is not sufficient for all my instruments on the drum machine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The snare needs a higher peak of 10 V or more in the envelope.
