VCO that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. It's based on two LM358 and one TL072, deadly simple.

FEATURES
âœ… Square and triangle wave
âœ… Frequency range from 0 Hz to 3.5 kHz
âœ… FM input with variable attenuation
âœ… Current: +17mA (+12V), -7 mA (-12V)

Swipe to see a video demo, some detailed photos, and the schematic.

This is the third PCB that I etched in lifetime. First one went into trash, second one works but soldering was a battlefield and this one is sufficiently fine ðŸ’¡
