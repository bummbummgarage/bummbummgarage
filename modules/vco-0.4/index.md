# VCO

*Version 0.4 from September 2020*

VCO that I pulled together for my drum machine project. It's based on a former standalone version and now migrated to Eurorack format since I decided to go into this direction.

## Features

* ✅ Square, triangle and sine wave
* ✅ Variable frequency range (30 Hz to 13 kHz)
* ✅ CV input with variable attenuation
* ✅ Variable DC

## Details

I found a thankful way to assemble the stripboard and the front panel by using the interface components, like the potis and audio jacks (Doepfer style).
