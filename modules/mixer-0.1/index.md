# Mixer

*Version 0.1 from March 2021*

![](163535509_204415484816763_6223775483818641984_n.jpg)

Mixer that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. Fun fact: At 110g, it's currently the heaviest of my modules â€“ because it has the most controls per square inch.

## Features

* âœ… 4 channels
* âœ… Volume and mute per channel
* âœ… Master volume and mute

## Details

The schematic is based on ["Introduction to Op-Amps - Part 2" by Jens Moller on colomar.com](http://colomar.com/Shavano/intro_opamp2.html).

The pots I use here are from Piher (PC-16 series), the jack sockets are from Lumberg (part number 1502 03) and the switches are from RND Electronics (ON-ON, SPDT).

The module can easily be extended with channels. Copy the according part in the schematic and stripboard layout, connect the lines and nothing will stop you ðŸš€

## Improvement Potential

All in all, the controls at the front are very tight. Unmuting the channels is easy because it is a downward movement with the finger. Muting takes some practice.
