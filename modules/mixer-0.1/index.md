# Mixer

*Version 0.1 from March 2021*

Mixer that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. Fun fact: At 110g, it's currently the heaviest of my modules â€“ because it has the most controls per square inch.

## Features

* âœ… 4 channels
* âœ… Volume and mute per channel
* âœ… Master volume and mute

## Details

The schematic is based on ["Introduction to Op-Amps - Part 2" by Jens Moller on colomar.com](http://colomar.com/Shavano/intro_opamp2.html).

The pots I use here are from Piher (PC-16 series), the jack sockets are from Lumberg (part number 1502 03).

The module can easily be extended with channels. Copy the according part in the schematic and stripboard layout, connect the lines and nothing will stop you ðŸš€

## Improvement Potential

All in all, the controls at the front are very tight. Unmuting the channels is easy because it is a downward movement with the finger. Muting takes some practice.
