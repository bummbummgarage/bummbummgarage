# Exponential Converter

*Version 0.1 from February 2021*

Exponential Converter that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. I wanted a snappy release based on the linear one from the Envelope Generator (EG). This will make the snare drum sound natural.

It's based on a design by Robin Mitchell in ["DIY Synth Series Part 1 ‚Äî The Exponential VCO"](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/diy-synth-series-vco/).

## Details

To find transistors with the same HFE, you have to match them. I used the instructions described in ["Transistor matching" by Kassutronics](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2015/10/transistor-matching.html) üëç

For the calibration I build a testing circuit with different voltage inputs (set by trimpots) and checked the output with a multimeter. You can see a photo of that and the resulting chart below. With the trimmers I set it to peak at ~10 volts input because this is where the CV of my envelope generators peak.
