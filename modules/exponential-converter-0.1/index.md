Exponential Converter that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. I wanted a snappy release based on the linear one from the Envelope Generator (EG). This will make the snare drum sound natural. With the trimmers I set it to peak at 8 volts input because my EGs have a maximum output of 8 volts.

It's based on a Design by Robin Mitchell in ["DIY Synth Series Part 1 ‚Äî The Exponential VCO"](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/diy-synth-series-vco/).

To find transistors with the same HFE, you have to match them. I used the instructions described in ["Transistor matching" by Kassutronics](https://kassu2000.blogspot.com/2015/10/transistor-matching.html) üëç

For the calibration I build a testing circuit with different voltage inputs (set by trimpots) and checked the output with a multimeter. You can see a photo of that and the resulting chart below.
