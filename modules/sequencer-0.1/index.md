Step sequencer that I built for my drum machine project. It's based on an Arduino Nano Every.

### Features

* ✅ 8 steps
* ✅ 3 tracks
* ✅ Speed control by external CV (triggers/gates forwarded with 5V)
* ✅ Speed control by internal clock (speed set by tapping, sending 5V triggers)
* ✅ Set and unset track hits on the run
* ✅ Predefined track patterns
