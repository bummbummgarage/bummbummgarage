Noise generator that I built for my modular synth drum machine project. It includes white and pink noise for the basis of hi-hats and a snare drum. The circuit needs at least +/-12V to run.

Swipe to see a demo, some detailled photos, the schematic and stripboard layout.

While plugging in the oscilloscope for the first time, I just realized the DC bias in the white noise â€“ to be removed in future development. That's why I'm still looking for alternative simple pink noise generating designs. 

Please let me know when you have some ðŸ˜Œ
