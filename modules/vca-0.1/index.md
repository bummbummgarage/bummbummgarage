VCA that I built for my drum machine project. It's very simple and actually passive by its original design. I just added some illumination, so it requires power supply. 

The design is based on ["1 transistor passive VCA-ish thingy" by shiftr via muffwiggler.com](https://www.muffwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2346401&sid=5fdd862b174f20972d7108f0cdba0f51#p2346401).

It doesn't seem to be 100%ly mature: First I can hear a high tones leaking through and second, it'll only work with positive voltages. But still enough for my requirements to synthesize a bass drum, a snare and a hi-hat üëç
