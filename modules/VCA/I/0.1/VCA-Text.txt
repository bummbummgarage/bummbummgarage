VCA that I built for my drum machine project. It's very simple and actually passive by its original design. I just added some illumination, so it requires power supply. 

Swipe to see a demo, some detailled photos, the schematic and stripboard layout.

It doesn't seem to be 100%ly mature: First I can hear a high tones leaking through and second, it'll only work with positive voltages. But still enough for my requirements to synthesize a bass drum, a snare and a hi-hat 👍

Still looking for alternative simple VCA designs. Please let me know when you have some 😌
